# exSCA
An extended version of Mark Rosenfelder's Sound Change Applier

### Downloads
Download executables via the releases page.

The latest release is [**Version 2.0.1**](https://github.com/bradrn/exSCA-cpp/releases).
The installer is named `exSCA-setup.exe`.

Unfortunately, exSCA-cpp is currently only available under Windows.
Hopefully I will be able to compile exSCA for Ubuntu soon, but unfortunately I do not anticipate a Mac version any time soon.

### Qt
exSCA-cpp uses the Qt library, licensed under the LGPL license.
